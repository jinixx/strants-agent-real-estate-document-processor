## ✅ What's Implemented

### Core Features
- **Document Classification**: Automatically identifies settlement documents, purchase agreements, and income verifications
- **Data Extraction**: Extracts critical transaction data including commission details and property information
- **Multi-Format Support**: Handles PDF, PNG, JPG, JPEG, and TIFF files (2-500 pages)
- **Quality Enhancement**: Automatically handles poor image quality and orientation issues
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently processes multiple documents with configurable batch sizes
- **Real-time Interface**: Clean Streamlit web interface with processing status and results display

### Technical Implementation
- **AWS Strands Agent SDK**: Uses the latest Strands framework for agent orchestration
- **Claude Sonnet on Bedrock**: Leverages Amazon Bedrock for AI-powered document analysis
- **Document Processing Pipeline**: Complete workflow from upload to structured data extraction
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and validation throughout the pipeline
- **Configuration Management**: Flexible configuration via environment variables

### Performance Targets
- **Processing Time**: Designed to reduce processing from 3-5 days to 1 day
- **Throughput**: Capable of handling 150,000+ annual settlement documents
- **Accuracy**: AI-powered classification and extraction with confidence scoring
- **Scalability**: Batch processing with configurable parameters

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Test the Setup
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/environment/capproject/StrandsDocumentProcessor
source venv/bin/activate
python demo.py
```

### 2. Configure AWS (Required for full functionality)
```bash
aws configure
# Enter your AWS credentials and set region to us-west-2
```

### 3. Enable Bedrock Model Access
- Go to AWS Console → Bedrock → Model Access
- Enable access to Claude 3 Sonnet model
- Wait for approval (usually immediate)

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
./run.sh
```
Then open http://localhost:8501 in your browser

## 📋 Document Types Supported

### Settlement Documents
- Property address and sale price
- Commission amount and percentage
- Closing date and parties involved
- Agent and brokerage information

### Purchase Agreements
- Purchase price and earnest money
- Buyer and seller details
- Closing date and contingencies
- Agent information

### Income Verification
- Applicant and employer information
- Annual income and employment status
- Employment dates and verification details

## 🔧 Configuration Options

Edit `.env` file to customize:
- AWS region and profile
- Bedrock model selection
- File size and page limits
- Processing timeouts
- Batch sizes

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest tests/
```

## 📊 User Feedback Integration

The application includes a built-in feedback system where users can request:
- Additional document types to support
- New data fields to extract
- General improvements and suggestions

## 🔍 Monitoring and Analytics

The system provides:
- Processing statistics and success rates
- Document type distribution analysis
- Confidence scoring for classifications and extractions
- Batch processing performance metrics

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **AWS Authentication**: Ensure AWS CLI is configured with proper credentials
2. **Bedrock Access**: Verify Claude Sonnet model is enabled in your AWS account
3. **File Formats**: Check that uploaded files are in supported formats
4. **File Size**: Ensure files are under 50MB and PDFs have fewer than 500 pages

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting `DEBUG=True` in `.env`

## 🎯 Next Steps for Production

1. **Security Enhancements**
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Add encryption for sensitive document data
   - Set up secure file storage (S3 with encryption)

2. **Scalability Improvements**
   - Implement queue-based processing for large batches
   - Add horizontal scaling capabilities
   - Optimize for concurrent processing

3. **Integration Options**
   - REST API for programmatic access
   - Webhook notifications for processing completion
   - Integration with existing real estate systems

4. **Advanced Features**
   - OCR integration for scanned documents
   - Document comparison and validation
   - Automated workflow triggers
